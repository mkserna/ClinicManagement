# Appointment Management System for a Private Clinic

This project aims to develop a digital solution for managing appointments at a private clinic. As a junior developer, your task is to build a system that addresses several challenges currently faced by the clinic in its appointment management process. The goal is to create a streamlined and efficient system that can handle scheduling, medical histories, availability tracking, and appointment conflicts. Below is a breakdown of the issues and the solution objectives.

## Challenges Faced by the Clinic

### 1. **Schedule Conflicts**
   - **Overlapping Appointments**: The clinic often schedules multiple appointments at the same time for the same doctor. This leads to last-minute rescheduling, causing frustration among patients and disrupting the doctor's daily routine.
   - **Uncertainty in Doctor Availability**: The current system does not have a reliable way to track a doctor's availability in real time, which causes confusion when scheduling appointments.

### 2. **Duplicate Appointments**
   - **Double Confirmation**: Sometimes, patients receive double confirmation or end up with multiple appointments for the same issue due to errors in manual record-keeping. This results in wasted time and missed appointments.
   - **Lack of Visibility on Past Appointments**: The clinic does not have a clear history of past appointments, making it difficult to track patient progress or review previous treatments.

### 3. **Inadequate Follow-Up on Medical History**
   - **No Clear Appointment History**: When patients return, the administrative staff or doctors do not have easy access to the patient's appointment history, which complicates medical reviews and may lead to repeated requests for information.
   - **Manual Record-Keeping Problems**: Attempts to use spreadsheets for tracking appointments are impractical, especially with an increasing patient volume, leading to errors and inefficiency.

### 4. **Limited Visibility of Doctor Availability**
   - **Complicated Schedule Access**: Staff must consult multiple spreadsheets to check if a doctor is available, which delays the scheduling process and sometimes results in overbooked slots.
   - **Rebooking Difficulties**: If a doctor is absent or needs to cancel an appointment, there is no automatic way to reschedule patients, leading to a manual, error-prone process.

## Objectives for the Appointment Management System

The clinic needs a system that resolves these issues and streamlines appointment scheduling, making it more efficient and error-free. Key objectives include:

- **User Access Based on Role**: The system must allow different types of users (doctors, patients, administrative staff) to access the system based on their roles, with the appropriate permissions.
  
- **Centralized and Organized Information**: The system should eliminate confusion and duplication by centralizing all appointment-related data. Each user should have easy access to the information pertinent to their role.

- **Real-Time Availability Tracking**: When a new appointment is scheduled, the system must update the doctor's availability in real-time to prevent overlapping appointments and maintain accurate schedules.

- **Intuitive and User-Friendly Interface**: The system should be simple enough for non-technical users to operate easily, with clear views of doctor availability, scheduled appointments, and a straightforward appointment booking process.

- **Future Scalability**: The system should be designed to easily incorporate new features or integrations in the future without requiring a complete overhaul.

## Acceptance Criteria

To meet the clinic’s needs, the system must meet the following acceptance criteria:

- **User Registration and Login**: Users should be able to register, log in, and interact with the system based on their role (doctor, patient, admin).
- **Prevent Appointment Conflicts**: The system must prevent scheduling two appointments at the same time for the same doctor.
- **Real-Time Availability Updates**: The doctor’s availability must be updated immediately when a new appointment is scheduled.
- **Conflict Warnings**: The system should provide warnings when an appointment is scheduled for a time when the doctor is unavailable.
- **Appointment Details**: Each appointment should include information about the reason for the visit.
- **Filtering Options**: Users should be able to filter appointments by date, specialty, or reason for visit.
- **Notes and Comments**: Users should be able to add notes or comments to appointments.
- **Role-Based Data Access**: Users should only have access to information that is relevant to their role.

This project will improve the clinic's appointment scheduling process, minimize errors, and enhance both patient and staff experiences.
